 Pixel based brain tumor detection with 14 image filters feature extraction technique.

### Abstract

**Accurate granular detection of Brain tumor region from a MRI scans is crucial for neurologists to pinpoint the affected part of the brain. As a result, there is a continuous need to enhance machine learning model for tumor classification, ensuring precision and generalization across different patient dataset.​**

**In previous work, the study utilized the image filtering-based feature extraction techniques using 8 image filters alongside a pixel-based brain tumor detection technique on a single volumetric dataset from BraTS 2015 dataset. To build on this, Our current research has integrated 6 additional image filters, enhancing the feature extraction process across multiple volumetric dataset, making the study more robust.​**

**Utilizing the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2020 dataset and specifically leveraging the T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (T2-FLAIR) MRI modality, this research draws from a larger and more diverse patient dataset to improve the model's generalization and robustness against local heterogeneity brain structure and tumor characteristics.**

**The Simulation shows that the Random Forest classifier achieve the precision scores of about 95.35%. They also achieve the F1-score of about 95.34%.The test results of the predictions across other volumetric dataset demonstrate similarly strong performances.​**
